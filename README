### Introduction

SpanishWall is a little tool for English-speaking Spanish learners. The idea is
to show dictionary definitions of Spanish words as wallpaper, helping you
build your Spanish vocabulary.

### How To Use

SpanishWall works by taking a list of Spanish words (from words.txt), and uses
Mirriam-Webster's Dictionary API to fetch the definition of the word. 

The definition is then rendered onto an image which can be used as the system
wallpaper.

To use SpanishWall, create an API key at https://dictionaryapi.com/ and set it
up at config.py. Also update the other variables in config.py to your
preference.

Then run main.py to generate the wallpapers.

Finally you can point your OS to the walls directory so it uses the images from
there as the wallpaper. SpanishWall doesn't do this for you.
